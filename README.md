# AutomationChallenge
Solution to the challenge imposed by @dvillarpsl

1. Create a project with 2 folders, the first one needs to have the UI Automation Tests, and the second needs to have the API Automation Tests (Like a solution with multiple projects)
2. Review your FE / BE project, and select 2 behaviors that you want to test (All of your are a team, then, your should not have duplicated tests)
3. Upload the "Solution" to Github and on the readme, explain what are your testing and how run them.

SUPER BONUS

1. Explain your tests using some business language framework
2. Include your tests on the same folder that you have your FE / BE code
3. Make your tests based on the requirements that you made on the class T2 - Requirements
4. Test your own exposed application (If you have it on heroku or another server)

# EXPLANATION

1. It's done, up there the folders can be seen.
2. I chose the User stories about visualizing a topic and deleting a topic, both of the User stories can be seen [here](URL "https://mercurio.psl.com.co:9443/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?title=US3+-+Visualize+topic+to+guide&spaceKey=EP") and [here](URL "https://mercurio.psl.com.co:9443/confluence/display/EP/US4+-+Remove+topic+to+guide") respectively.
